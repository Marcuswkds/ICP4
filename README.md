Description of ICP:  machine learning, and how to implement models such as Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Classification on different data sets. I was also introduced to more modules and learn how to split the x and y data.

#Question 1

I started by importing the module pandas as pd and reading the 'train.csv' file. I was then able to find the correlation between the 'Sex' and 'Survived' columns. The output returned was 0.5433513806577551 which meant that we should definitely keep this feature because there is a high correlation between the 'Sex' and 'Survived' columns. In conclusionm, the correlation shows that if you were a female that is a higher chance of you surviving.

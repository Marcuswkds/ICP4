import pandas as pd  # Importing module

train_df = pd.read_csv("train.csv")  # Reading the .csv file.
X_train = train_df.drop("Survived", axis=1)
Y_train = train_df["Survived"]
train_df['Sex'] = train_df['Sex'].map({'male': 0, 'female': 1}).astype(int)  # To find the correlation between 'Sex' and 'Survived' variables
print(train_df['Survived'].corr(train_df['Sex']))  # Printing the output to the user.
